# Qub for Typescript

Qub is a platform/library of code that I've created and added to over the years. In general, it consists of data structures, tokenizers, parsers, as well as a platform layer to base applications on.

I believe in simple developer workflows. If there isn't a single command you can run to setup a repository, then I believe the repository isn't structured correctly. With this in mind, to start working on this repository, you just have to run three commands:

1. git clone https://github.com/danschultequb/qub
2. **initialize.cmd**
3. **build.cmd**

This will completely clone, setup, and then build this repository. The workflow is currently only setup for a Windows environment, because that's what I use for development. I'll add Linux/Mac OS later when necessary.

You can run tests by using **test.cmd**. You can also check code coverage by using **coverage.cmd**.
